    <p>Broth is used as a basis for other edible liquids such as soup, gravy, or sauce. It can be eaten alone or with garnish.
       If other ingredients are used it is then generally called soup.<br>
       In simple words is just a set of components, i.e UI or JavaScript utilities, often reused in in many projects.
    </p>
    <h3>BrothJS is under development</h3>
    <p>
        The goal is modern browsers and technolgies in mind. <br>
        BrothJS may support older browsers if the need arises, but you are welcome to contribute.
