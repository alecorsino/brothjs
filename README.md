# BrothJS
Broth is used as a basis for other edible liquids such as soup, gravy, or sauce. It can be eaten alone or with garnish. If other ingredients are used it is then generally called soup.

In simple words is just a set of components often reused in in many projects, mainly targeting UI but will include JavaScript utilities as well,

## BrothJS is under development
The goal is modern browsers and technolgies in mind.
BrothJS may support older browsers if the need arises, but you are welcome to contribute.

## Why
I do it for fun and to hone my skills by solving problems WITHOUT using others frameworks.
Another reason is you often have similar requirements on every project so why not reuse the code you wrote hundred times!.
