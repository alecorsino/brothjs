# BrothJS
Broth is used as a basis for other edible liquids such as soup, gravy, or sauce. It can be eaten alone or with garnish. If other ingredients are used it is then generally called soup.

In simple words is just a set of components, i.e UI or JavaScript utilities, often reused in in many projects.

## Why

I do it for fun and to hone my skills by solving problems without using others frameworks.
Another reason is you often have similar requirements on every project so why not reuse the code you wrote hundred times!.
